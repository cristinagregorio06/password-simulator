## üõ°Ô∏è Objective

The main goal of this project is to educate users about the importance of strong passwords in the context of cybersecurity. This interactive web application allows anyone to test the strength of their passwords in real time and learn how to create secure credentials to protect their digital identity.

## üîç Description

**Secure Password Simulator** is a beginner-friendly, fully client-side web tool that helps users:

- **Test the strength of their passwords** as they type, with instant feedback.
- **Visualize password quality** using a progress bar and color-coded indicators (weak, medium, strong).
- **Understand password requirements** (length, uppercase, lowercase, numbers, symbols) with clear checklists.
- **Receive actionable tips** to improve password security.
- **Generate strong, random passwords** with customizable options (length, character types).
- **Copy and use generated passwords** easily.

No data is sent or stored anywhere‚Äîeverything runs locally in your browser for maximum privacy.

## üîí Why is this so important?

Weak passwords are one of the most common causes of security breaches. Many cyberattacks exploit simple, reused, or predictable passwords to gain unauthorized access to accounts and sensitive information. By using this simulator, users can:

- Learn what makes a password strong or weak.
- Understand the risks of using short or simple passwords.
- Practice creating passwords that are resistant to brute-force and dictionary attacks.
- Adopt better password habits, such as using a mix of character types and avoiding personal information.

**Cybersecurity starts with you!** This tool empowers users to take control of their digital safety by making informed decisions about password creation.

## üöÄ How to Use

1. **Enter a password** in the input field to see its strength and get improvement tips.
2. **Check the requirements** to see which criteria your password meets.
3. **Use the generator** to create a strong password with your preferred options.
4. **Copy and use** the generated password for your accounts.
